Hey, I am Rythm Rana, a software development engineer working extensively in frontend development for the past 3 years. I additionally took on the responsibilities of an automation tester as well during my first 1 year of employment and have even created and trained a team of manual testers for automation testing in my current company alongside contributing as a lead frontend developer.
I am new to the TDD world but i believe there is nothing that can't be learnt and mastered with practice. so please find this mini project displaying what i learnt about TDD and i will be committing my changes incrementally to display my thought process. Thank you.
